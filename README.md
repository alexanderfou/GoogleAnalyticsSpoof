# Google Analytics Spoof (OUTDATED)
python program to fake pageviews on google analytics with options to rotate geiod, screen resolutions, useragents, languages, and more

**NOTE: Works in versions of Google Analytics <= GA3. Google Analytics 4 requires an API key to send data.

# **How it works**  
the program requests a url (google-analytics.com/collect) and passes fake variables  
every time it changes the url slightly to seem like a different user  
it can rotate geiods, referrers, resolutions, user agents, page names, languages, almost anything
