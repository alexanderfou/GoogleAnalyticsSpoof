# Google Analytics Spoof
python program to fake pageviews on google analytics with options to rotate geiod, screen resolutions, useragents, languages, and more

#How it works
the program requests a url (google-analytics.com/collect) and passes fake variables \n
every time it changes the url slightly to seem like a different user \n
it can rotate geiods, referrers, resolutions, user agents, page names, languages, almost anything
