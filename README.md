# Google Analytics Spoof
python program to fake pageviews on google analytics with options to rotate geiod, screen resolutions, useragents, languages, and more

**How it works**  
the program requests a url (google-analytics.com/collect) and passes fake variables  
every time it changes the url slightly to seem like a different user  
it can rotate geiods, referrers, resolutions, user agents, page names, languages, almost anything
